hello world!


I think python is much better than java
but I think javascript is a good kind of program language
because I think JS have similar pattern with python
python is most simplisity language,so it is powerful and straight,

so python is a beautiful language.
life is short,I love python!

but life need more interests,so I think Java is a good example to learn,
other kind of program language:PHP,perl,C++,I think I will get them someday.
wait me ok?
